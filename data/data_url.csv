art_3160329_para_13,"Center for Disease Detection LLC, San Antonio, Texas, is awarded a $55,806,150 indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract. Laboratory testing under this contract is broad in scope and encompasses a range of disciplines. It is Department of Defense (DOD) policy to deny eligibility for military service to persons with laboratory evidence of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B, or Hepatitis C. As a result, all applicants for military service must be tested for the viruses prior to entry into military service. Additionally, it is DOD policy to periodically screen service members for HIV, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C. SECNAVINST 5300.30F outlines the management of these viruses within the Navy and Marine Corps and requires tracking of positive test results by the Navy Blood-borne Infection Management Center (NBIMC). NBIMC oversees the administration and aids in the development of policies concerning the HIV, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C screenings for the Department of the Navy (DON), as directed by the Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) for the Bureau of Personnel (BUPERS). To meet HIV, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C screening requirements, the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard require the testing of approximately 60,000 – 90,000 specimens per month from approximately 1,300 submitting activities worldwide, including remote facilities. Support for Coast Guard operations is provided through NBIMC and not directly from Naval Medical Readiness Logistics Command. DOD has incorporated the use of contractor personnel as part of its overall manpower strategy for healthcare related services. Policy decisions have reduced the overall size of the active duty medical force, and available pay grades limit the ability to attract and retain civil service personnel. The use of contract staff to supplement organic resources is a widespread private sector practice that is mirrored through this acquisition. One component of Naval Medical Logistics Command’s (NMLC) mission is to meet customers' healthcare related service needs. NMLC has issued services contracts to acquire health care related services for more than 30 years and will use this approach to meet the needs of NBIMC.
